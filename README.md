Files to model diffusion-decay-ingrowth with underworld3.

underworld3 is required to run all models, the repository with an installation guide is included [here](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld3)


All diffusion benchmarks can be run from the [Run_diffusion_benchmarks.ipynb](https://github.com/bknight1/diffusionDecayIngrowth/blob/main/Poisson_solver_implementation/Diffusion/Run_diffusion_benchmarks.ipynb) notebook. This will also produce the figures included in the manuscript.


All models used to replicate the thermal evolution of the Trivandrum block and plot results can be run from the [TB_plots.ipynb](https://github.com/bknight1/diffusionDecayIngrowth/blob/main/Poisson_solver_implementation/TB_case_study/TB_plots.ipynb) notebook.

We also have a bilder, where all models can be run in the cloud (but may take a while to run)

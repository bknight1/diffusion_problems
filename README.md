Files to model various diffusion-based problems with underworld3.

underworld3 is required to run all models, the repository with an installation guide is included [here](https://github.com/underworldcode/underworld3). UWDiffusion is also required for the streamlined scripts, and can be found [here](https://github.com/bknight1/UWDiffusion)


All diffusion benchmarks can be run from the [Run_diffusion_benchmarks.ipynb](https://github.com/bknight1/diffusionDecayIngrowth/blob/main/Poisson_solver_implementation/Diffusion/Run_diffusion_benchmarks.ipynb) notebook. This will also produce the figures included in the manuscript. There are also bash scripts to run all models using UWDiffusion.

We also have a bilder, where all models can be run in the cloud (but may take a while to run)
